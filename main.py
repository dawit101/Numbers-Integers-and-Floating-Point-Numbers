#Fundamental Data Type
#int = integer, which is just a whole number
#float = floating point number, which means number with decimal point
#type(...) means to see what kind of datatype it is

print(type(2 + 4)) #6, so its int
print(type(2 - 4)) #-2, so its int
print(type(2 / 4)) #0.5, so its float

print(type(0.00001)) #0.00001 is float data type

print(type(20 + 1.1)) #21.1, so its float

print(type(9.9 +1.1)) #11.0, so its a float

print(2 ** 3) #2 to the 3rd power, 2^3 = 8

print(2 // 4) #divides and rounds down to next integer
print(6 // 4) #divides and rounds down to next integer

print(6 % 4) # % = modulo, is used to find remainder of division, so 6/4 has a remainder of 2
print(8 % 3) #8/3 is 2 with the remainder of 2
